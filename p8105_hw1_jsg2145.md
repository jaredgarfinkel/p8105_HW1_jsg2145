# Data Science I P8104

I am in Data Science I P8104.

## HW1

This is my first homework assignment.

### Problem 1

This is the first problem of the problem set. Load the
    library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## -- Attaching packages ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ tidyverse 1.2.1 --

    ## v ggplot2 3.2.1     v purrr   0.3.2
    ## v tibble  2.1.3     v dplyr   0.8.3
    ## v tidyr   0.8.3     v stringr 1.4.0
    ## v readr   1.3.1     v forcats 0.4.0

    ## -- Conflicts --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse_conflicts() --
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

Here’s a dataframe.

``` r
df1 = tibble(
  samp = rnorm(8),
  samp_pos = samp > 0,
  char_vec = list("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8"),
  fact_vec = factor(levels = "factor1", "factor2","factor3"))
```

Take the mean of each vector:

I can take the mean of samp = 0.2520553

I can take the mean of samp\_pos = 0.625, but it won’t tell me much

The mean of a character vector doesn’t make sense, NA

Neither does one for a factor, NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df1, samp_pos))
as.numeric(pull(df1, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(df1, fact_vec))
```

I happened to use numbers for my character vector, so they were
converted to numbers.

However, my factors were characters and they did not convert to numbers.
